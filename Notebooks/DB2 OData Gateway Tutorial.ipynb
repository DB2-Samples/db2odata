    "## An Brief Introduction to OData\n",
    "Rather than paraphrase what OData does, here is the official statement from the OData home page:\n",
    "\n",
    "http://www.odata.org/\n",
    "\n",
    ">OData (Open Data Protocol) is an ISO/IEC approved, OASIS standard that defines a set of best practices for building and consuming RESTful APIs. OData helps you focus on your business logic while building RESTful APIs without having to worry about the various approaches to define request and response headers, status codes, HTTP methods, URL conventions, media types, payload formats, query options, etc. OData also provides \n",
    "guidance for tracking changes, defining functions/actions for reusable procedures, and sending asynchronous/batch requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why OData for DB2?\n",
    "Customers have a wealth of data in their databases (not just DB2) and publishing it to different devices is often fraught with many challenges. DB2 requires the use of client code to communicate between the application and the database itself. Many of APIs that are used are well known: JDBC, .Net, ODBC, OLE-DB, CLI and so on. Most programming languages have some sort of connector that maps from the language syntax to the database driver. When a new language gets developed it always needs this driver code to talk to the database. For instance, this Python notebook is communicating to DB2 natively using the ibm_db package. Without some specialized coding, there would be no way to communicate with DB2.\n",
    "\n",
    "OData tries to remove much of the complexity of communicating with the database. There are no drivers required, no configuration file, nor any administration required on the client that is communicating with the database. All communication is done using RESTful API calls, which are available on all browsers and all operating systems. The calls to the database are replaced with standard POST, GET, DELETE, PUT and PATCH requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "OData goes one step further and removes the syntactical differences between SQL vendors. The INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE and SELECT statements are coverted to a canonical form that should be interpreted by all vendors. Of course, interoperability depends on how much of the standard a vendor has implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "The end result is that an Iphone, Andriod phone, tablet, browser or any application will be able to access the database without having any code installed locally. This simplifies the ability to access the database and makes development considerably easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "The downside to this approach is that the richness of a particular SQL dialect will not be available through OData. Complex SQL with aggregation functions and moving result windows are not a good candidate to use with OData. However, OData covers much of the query spectrum that traditional applications will use, so it makes it a good choice for agile development.\n",
    "\n",
    "### OData to DB2 Extension\n",
    "Writing OData calls to DB2 requires a knowledge of the OData syntax, the RESTful calling sequence, and an understanding of the level of support of OData that DB2 provides. This tutorial will take you through all of the functions that the OData gateway currently provides and show how these calls are implemented. Feel free to use the code and extensions in your own applications."

    "## DB2 and OData Connection Requirements\n",
    "Both the DB2 client and OData calls need connection information. The way that you go about connecting to the database is completely different between these two protocols. Let first start with the DB2 connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "DB2 requires a userid and password to connect to a database (along with the client code that talks to DB2 over the network). Assuming you have a DB2 database somewhere, the next command will ask you for the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    " * DATABASE name - The name of the DB2 database you want to connect to\n",
    " * HOST ipaddress - The IP address (or localhost) where the DB2 instance can be found\n",
    " * PORT portno - The PORT number that DB2 is listening to (usually 50000)\n",
    " * USER userid - The user that will be connecting to DB2\n",
    " * PASSWORD pwd - The password for the USER (use a \"?\" to prompt for the value)\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to have this information available or the program won't be able to connect. For demonstration purposes, the standard SAMPLE database should be used but in the event you don't have that created, the %sql command will generate the necessary tables for you. It is also good to be a DBADM (database administrator) on the system you are connecting to. This will allow you to create the services requires by the OData gateway. If you don't, someone with that authority will be needed to give you access through OData.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Connecting through OData\n",
    "Connecting through OData requires a different approach than a DB2 client. We still need to ask a bunch of questions on how we connect to the database, but this doesn't create a connection from the client. Instead what we end up creating is a service URL. This URL gives us access to DB2 through the OData gateway server.\n",
    "\n",
    "The OData Server take the URL request and maps it to a DB2 resource, which could be one or more tables. The RESTful API needs this URL to communicate with DB2 but nothing else (userids, passwords, etc...) are sent with the request.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following %odata command will prompt you for the connection parameters, similar to what happened with the DB2 connect. There are a few differences however. The connection requires the userid and password of the user connecting to the database, and the userid and password of a user with administration (DBABM) privileges.\n",
    "\n",
    "The administrative user creates the service connection that will be used to communicate through the OData gateway and DB2. The regular userid and password is for the actual user that will connect to the database to manipulate the tables. Finally we need to have the schema (or owner) of the tables that will be accessed. From a DB2 perspective, this is similar to connecting to a DATABASE (SAMPLE) as userid FRED. The EMPLOYEE table was created under the userid DB2INST1, so to access the table we need to use DB2INST1.EMPLOYEE. If we didn't include the schema (DB2INST1), the query would fail since FRED was not the owner of the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "The %odata PROMPT command will request all of the connection parameters and explain what the various fields are. Note: If you have DBADM privileges (and you created the sample tables yourself), you can leave the USERID/PASSWORD/SCHEMA values blank and they will default to the administrative user values."

The calls to the database are replaced with standard POST, GET, DELETE, PUT and PATCH requests.
